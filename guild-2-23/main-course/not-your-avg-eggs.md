# Not Your Average Scrambled Eggs

> Ever wondered how restaurants make nice and fluffy scrambled #eggs that hold together and aren’t burned? It’s all in the stirring. #welcome

- Eggs | 2 | 
- Milk | 1-2 oz | 

> Whole milk is best. Cream could also be used. You can experiment with the amount if you want, but some milk is necessary.

Crack eggs into a bowl with milk. Add any spices or seasoning that you enjoy. Beat the egg mixture with a fork until smooth.

Heat a nonstick pan on medium heat

> Make sure that the pan is thoroughly heated and coated with a thin layer of grease. This may not be necessary on all nonstick surfaces, but the VERY thin layer of grease helps make sure the eggs won’t stick to the pan while cooking.

Pour the egg mixture into the pan and let sit for about 10 seconds. You can tell the pan is hot enough if the eggs instantly start to sizzle and bubble.

Start to push the eggs around the pan in a circular motion. Use the eggs as a broom to sweep up the rest of the eggs from the surface of the pan to form a single serving of eggs. Continue in the circular motion while the eggs cook.

> The whole cooking process should be pretty fast. The eggs should spend less than a minute in the pan. If cooking takes longer, increase the heat for the next batch.

If necessary, flip the eggs over to cook the top side. Sometimes this isn’t necessary depending on how the eggs cook. Continue pushing the eggs in a circular motion.

Take the eggs off the heat and serve.

> This recipe came from a trip to Japan. While we were there having brunch at a restaurant, which served some of the best scrambled eggs I’ve ever had, we asked the staff how they made their scrambled eggs - and they showed us. This technique works really well and makes delicious scrambled eggs every time.
