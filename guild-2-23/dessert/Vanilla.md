## Instructions:

1. In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, vanilla bean seeds and pod, and salt. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it comes to a simmer.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks until they are pale in color.

3. Remove the vanilla bean pod from the saucepan and discard it. Slowly pour the hot cream mixture into the bowl with the egg yolks, whisking constantly, until fully combined.

4. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Be careful not to let the mixture boil.

5. Remove the saucepan from the heat and strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl.

6. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap directly onto the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming.

7. Chill the custard in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight.

8. Churn the custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.

9. Transfer the churned ice cream to a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 2 hours, or until firm.

10. Scoop and enjoy!
